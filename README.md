# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this program, I have used different techniques to solve a particular problem, we face in preprocessing data. Sometimes data can be imbalanced, so it causes ML models to bias towards those classes which are in majority.
So to solve this issue I have used techniques up sampling, down sampling and combine sampling. I have also used some ensemble methods. After sampling, we have balanced that we pass to the model for classification. After giving data to model, we have now accuracy, precision and recall. Finally we can conclude what is best model and technique among all these techniques
